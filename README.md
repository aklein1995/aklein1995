# Hi, I'm Alain! 👋  
                
## 🚀 About Me  
Born in 1995, I am an active, sport-loving, self-taught millennial passionate about technology. Originally from Spain, I bring a diverse perspective to my work and continuously seek new challenges and opportunities to learn.

I hold a PhD in Mobile Network Information and Communication Technologies (Cum Laude), with a specialization in Reinforcement Learning (RL). My research specifically tackled sparse reward problems, emphasizing the importance of exploration in environments where feedback signals are limited. 

👩‍💻 I'm currently working on Tecnalia, where I am involved in innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.

🧠 I'm currently learning advanced machine learning techniques and how to apply them to real-world problems.

💬 Ask me about web development, data science, and any interesting tech trends.
