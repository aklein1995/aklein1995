# Hi, I'm Alain! 👋  
                
## 🚀 About Me  
Born in 1995, I am an active, sport-loving, self-taught millennial passionate about technology. Originally from Spain, I bring a diverse perspective to my work and continuously seek new challenges and opportunities to learn.

I hold a PhD in Mobile Network Information and Communication Technologies (Cum Laude), with a specialization in Reinforcement Learning (RL). My research specifically tackled sparse reward problems, emphasizing the importance of exploration in environments where feedback signals are limited. 

👩‍💻 **R&D Data Scientist at Tecnalia**, where I drive cutting-edge projects that push the limits of today’s technology.

🧠 **Lecturer at the University of Deusto**, where I share my expertise and inspire the next generation of engineers.
